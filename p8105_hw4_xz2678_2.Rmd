```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggridges)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
data_pups <- read_csv("./FAS_pups.csv")%>%
  clean_names()%>%
  gather(key= PD_outcome, value= days, pd_ears:pd_walk)
```

Load and wrangle the dataset. After combining PD ears, PD eyes, PD pivot, PD walk 4 columns into one single variable named **pd_outcomes**, we get the final dataset with `r dim(data_pups)[1]` observations.
